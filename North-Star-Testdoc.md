### Vision of the Open Voice Network: our North Star ###

Conversational AI is in its earliest days.  It is rapidly moving toward a global future that will be multi-platform, multi-device,  multi-modal, and found in every industry.  It promises significant value not only to conversational AI providers, but to its users -- the enterprises, marketers and communicators, operational managers, developers and designers, and billions of individuals worldwide.

However, a broad issue of dis-trust now blankets conversational AI, and inhibits the realization of user value.  To realize its potential, conversational AI must be open and worthy of user trust.  It must be open for development and innovation.  It must be trust-worthy in its ease and reliability use, in its direct and unfiltered access to desired destinations, in its commercial and data usage and privacy, in its cross-platform interoperability, in lack of bias, in its development languages and protocols.  

Through the centuries, the development and adoption of standards has repeatedly catalyzed ever-advancing use, innovation, ecosystem development, and economic growth for new technologies.  We, the sponsors and supporters of The Open Voice Network, believe that now -- at the dawn of conversational AI's multi-platform future -- is the time to communally develop and drive toward adoption the conversational AI standards that will enable user trust.  

Our work could include the development and proposal of standards that will enable:
- platform-independent and dependable destination accessibility
- platform-indepedent user identification and authentication
- the interoperability of conversational AI platforms
- consent-driven commercial and consumer privacy; 
- commands and phraseology for common business processes;
- language inclusivity;
- open development.
