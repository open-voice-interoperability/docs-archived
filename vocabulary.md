## A
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - also known as machine intelligence. A type of computer science focused on designing intelligent computer systems that exhibit characteristics of human behavior. AI is an academic discipline that has multiplesub-fields such as Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, Robotics, Speech Processing, Machine Learning. Conversational AI - is the set of technologies to enable automated communication between computers and humans. This communication can be speech and text. Conversational AI recognizes speech and text, understands intent, decipher various languages, and responds where it mimics human conversation. In some cases, it is also known as Natural Language Processing. Utterance - spoken or typed phrases.

- **Automatic Speech Recognition** - also known as Speech-To-Text or computer speech recognition. It is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that enables the recognition and translation of auditory utterance to text.

## B

## C
- **Channel** - an interface and origin of communication. It is where the utterances are received. Examples: smart devices, mobile phones, web sites, mobile app, etc. Also known as Conversation Endpoint.
- **Component** - See conversational processors.
- **Combo-Component** - Component that performs the functions of two or more components.  Examples (1) The functions of an ASR component are combined with the functions of a NLP component to accept audio input and produce a semantic structure as output.  (2) the functions  ASR component are combined with the functions of a Emotion Detection  component to accept audio input and two outputs (text and identified emotions.
- **Component interoperability** - A component of a platform may be replaced by another component from a different vendor. I.e., replace the TTS by another TTS from a different vendor.
- **Conversation** - Conversation is a joint activity in which two or more agents (human or automated) use linguistic forms and nonverbal signals (eg. gestures) to communicate to achieve an outcome that meets a shared goal.
- **Conversational Agent** - A Conversation agent is a participant in a conversation. An Agent may be a person or an Application with a consistent Persona. Examples of Agents may include Google Assistant, Alexa, the Walmart Alexa Skill, the Target Google Assistant Action, a Facebook Messenger chatbot, an Apple Business Chat Conversational AI chatbot, or an IVR system at a bank. Conversational Agent is a common term utilized in the area of Dialogue System research and university level instruction [6,7,8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Two types of conversational agents are bots and people.
- **Conversational AI** - is the set of technologies to enable automated communication between computers and humans. This communication can be speech and text. Conversational AI recognizes speech and text, understands intent, decipher various languages, and responds where it mimics human conversation. In some cases, it is also known as Natural Language Processing.
- **Conversational Context** - There is a lack of consensus on what Conversation Context means. More research is required to define what Conversation Context means in a Dialogue System. For the time being, we shall define Conversation Context as information extracted from N prior utterances of the current conversation.  For clarity this would include some or all of the following: information that has been input, output or inferred in Conversational Processors; and the information state of the Dialog Manager.  A summary of current research on context is detailed below.  
 
   In the areas of Social Anthropology (Ethnography) and Conversation Analysis, practitioners express a notion of talk-extrinsic and talk-intrinsic context in conversation,18, but have not formalized a definition, method or language for labeling it. Van Dijk19 has attempted to further define conversation context with a theoretical framework for some aspects of a context model that could be developed further. In the area of Psychology, some work has been done to encode context in conversation based upon partner-specific contextual information20.  
 
   In the domain of Dialogue Systems research, inclusion of context is often referenced but ill-defined, save one attempt to categorize types of contextual information (Dybkjaer 201221). There is however a thematic application of the term for utilizing prior features in a conversation to adapt one or more models in a (dialogue) system.
- **Conversational Platform** - the system or services that handle the two-way interaction with the user and the entity.  The platform owns the task of understanding the user's utterance, translating it to humans, and machine exchange, and making sure it is reaching the right entity. 
- **Conversation Endpoint** - Agents conduct Conversations via a Conversation Endpoint (Endpoint). A Conversation Endpoint may include a phone, mobile device, voice speaker, personal computer, kiosk, or any other device that enables an Agent to participate in a Conversation. Endpoints are sometimes referred to as a 'Channel'.   Standards related to Conversation Endpoints are currently out of scope. 


## D
- **Dialog Broker (DB)** - is responsible for providing the fulfillable intents available for a resolved VRS record (e.g. where resolved VRS record "BigGrocery", it’s fulfillable intents might be "order product, check order status, add to shopping list". These fulfillable intents can execute remotely on the DM or download locally on the device.
- **Dialog Manager (DM)** - handles the dynamic response of the conversation. It provides a more personalized response based on the action provided by the NLP to send back to the user.
- **Disambiguate** - when the conversational platform hypothesizes two or more possible resolutions to a user utterance, it may ask the user for additional clarification or choose between the various interpretations to decide the user's correct intention. 


## E
- **Entity** - is a part of the structured machine translation. It is a custom level data type and considered a concrete value to associate a word in a query. This is also known as annotations.
- **Entity** -  government or private/public company that provides certain businesses or services.
- **Explicit Invocation** - an invocation type where the user invokes the channel, and it is explicitly stating a direct command to accomplish a specific task. The direct authority is to communicate directly to a registered voice application.

## F
## G
## H
## I
- **Invocation** - is part of the construct of the user's utterance during a conversation with a channel. An invocation describes a specific function that the guest wants and expecting a particular response.
- **Intent** - is a part of the structured machine translation. It is the identified action that the machine interprets based on the user's query. This is also known as classifiers.
- **Implicit Invocation** - an invocation type where the user invokes the channel, and use the most common words or indirectly saying the explicit Invocation. 

## J
## K
## L
## M
## N
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** - a service and a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers communicate with humans in their language and scales other language-related tasks. NLP helps structure highly complicated, unstructured human utterance and vice-versa. Natural Language Understanding is a subset of NLP that is responsible for understanding the meaning of the user's utterance and classifying it into proper intents.

## O
## P
- **Platform** - The collection of components (the environment) needed to execute a voice application.  Examples of platforms include the Amazon and Google platforms that execute voice applications.

## Q
- **Query** - user’s word requesting for specific function and expecting a particular response.

## R
## S
- **Speech-To-Text (STT)** - is converting the response from an audio to a text.

## T
- **Text-To-Speech (TTS)** - is a text converting to audio. Also known as Automatic Speech Recognition. It includes customized models to overcome common speech recognition barriers, such as unique vocabularies, speaking styles, or background noise.
- **Technical Resource** -  it can be a publisher/developer. It can be a representative of an entity or independent party. Their role is to create an actual listing of the voice application.

## U
- **Utterance** - spoken or typed phrases.
- **User** - a person who interacts with channels.  

## V
- **Voice Application** - also known as skill, action, capsule or domain. This is the specific executable component that has association to multiple things such as invocation, collection of related intents and entities up to the configuration to your dialog manager.
- **Voice Application Interoperability** – a voice application involves another voice application.
- **Voice Assistant System** A system where a user (primarily) uses his/her voice to interact with an automated conversational assistant for information or to control devices. 
- **Voice Registry System (VRS)** - is a global entity type in OVN and considered one of the most central components. It is a registry system with similarities to Domain Name System (DNS), but for voice. VRS resolves requests to dialog management endpoints, NLP providers, and the dialog broker. VRS serves consistently regardless of the NLP.


## W
- **Wake Word** - a specific word that will catch the attention of the channel.
