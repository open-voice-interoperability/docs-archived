## Status

In progress

Supercedes [](0002-vrs-type.md)

## Context

Identify the components the VRS will integrate with that includes the parameters that needed to be passed. 



## Decision

Components that will call the VRS are the following:
### 1. Voice Assistant Platform (VAS)
- Search for registered names (GET)

### 2. VRS User Interface for registration, searching, and updating status
- Register new names (post)
- Update information for current registered names (PUT)
- Cancel registration for current registered names (PUT)
- Search for registered names (GET)

### 3. Local VRS resolver (Internet Of Things)
- Search for registered names (GET)

Local implementation of VRS is a requirement to highlight the importance of privacy and enterprise-level implementation.

In summary, VRS will always have a system-to-system integration and not directly to the user. These integrations are in alignment with our architecture guiding principle about VRS.

## Consequences

There is no imminent consequence at the moment outside of the amount of work that needs to happen.
